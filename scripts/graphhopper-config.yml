# GraphHopper 11.0 configuration for CurveCall graph building.
#
# This config is used by build-graph.sh to produce routing graph directories
# from OSM PBF extracts. The profiles defined here MUST match those in the
# Android app's GraphHopperRouter class:
#   - "car"        with custom model from car.json (built into GH JAR)
#   - "motorcycle"  with custom model from motorcycle.json (built into GH JAR)
#   - CH (Contraction Hierarchies) enabled for both
#
# GraphHopper version: 11.0
# Docs: https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/blob/master/docs/core/profiles.md
